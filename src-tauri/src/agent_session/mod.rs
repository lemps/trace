//! Agents run headless over a structured protocol, shown as a chat. See
//! docs/AGENT_CHAT.md.
//!
//! - `journal`: the rows every brand's conversation becomes, and what the UI renders.
//! - An adapter per brand implements `AgentAdapter` and turns its protocol into rows.
//!
//! This is the contract the runtime and the UI are built against; the runtime
//! (process handling, persistence, commands) and the adapters live beside it.
//!
//! - `registry`: the chat agents, starting, running or stopping.
//! - `runtime`: starting and driving them, and the sink that persists and emits rows.
//! - `store`: the journal file; `settle`: rows a vanished process left open.
//! - `transport`: whether each workspace runs as a chat or in the terminal.
//! - `claude`, `codex`: the adapters; `brands` picks one by its CLI.
//! - `attachments`: files sent with a message (pasted ones saved to disk first).
//! - `options`: each workspace's model, effort and permission mode.
